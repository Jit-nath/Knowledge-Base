# Online Services

Several platforms provide **IPFS hosting, pinning, and API access** to simplify decentralized storage without needing to run your own node.

## Pinning Services

These services keep your files persistently available on the IPFS network:

- **[Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/)** – Offers UI, API, and file pinning with access control.
- **[Web3.Storage](https://web3.storage/)** – Built by Protocol Labs, allows storing files easily with a simple API.
- **[NFT.Storage](https://nft.storage/)** – Free service designed for storing NFT metadata on IPFS.
- **[Infura IPFS](https://infura.io/product/ipfs)** – Provides IPFS API + gateway with reliable infrastructure.

## Public Gateways

Gateways allow accessing IPFS content via HTTP:

- `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<CID>`
- `https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/<CID>`
- `https://w3s.link/ipfs/<CID>`

## API Access

Many services provide SDKs or REST APIs to upload, pin, and manage IPFS content programmatically.

Popular SDKs:
- `web3.storage` JS SDK
- `pinata-sdk` (Node.js)
- `nft.storage` SDK

These are ideal for integrating IPFS with dApps, web platforms, or NFT projects.
