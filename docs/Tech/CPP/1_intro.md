>Author - [Jit Debnath](https://github.com/Jit-nath)

C++ is an amazing language powering many browsers game engines even many operating systems. It combines the efficiency of C with additional features like object-oriented programming, making it a versatile choice for various applications.

## History
C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs starting in 1979. Initially, it was called "C with Classes" as it introduced object-oriented features to the C programming language. The first commercial release was in 1985. Over the years, C++ has evolved with the addition of numerous features, including templates, exceptions, and the Standard Template Library (STL). The language has undergone several standardizations, with the most notable versions being C++98, C++03, C++11, C++14, C++17, and C++20, each introducing new features and improvements.
